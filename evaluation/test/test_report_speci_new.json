      "[ORG: Apple Inc.] Tariffs and Other Trade Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. ('U.S. Tariffs'), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union ('EU'), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company's products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company's supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company's products and services, all of which can further adversely affect  the  Company's business and results of operations.",

The first material  performance  obligation,  which  represents  the  substantial  portion  of  the  allocated  sales  price,  is  the  hardware  and  bundled  software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae ,  Siri and  Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative  SSPs.  Because  the  Company  lacks  observable  prices  for  product-related  bundled  services,  the  allocation  of  revenue  is  based  on  the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. \u00ae\nFor  certain  long-term  service  arrangements,  the  Company  has  performance  obligations  for  services  it  has  not  yet  delivered.  For  these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services.

These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products."

Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.

      "[ORG: AMAZON COM INC] Foreign Exchange Risk\nDuring Q3 2024, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2024 decreased by $46 million in comparison with Q3 2023.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of September 30, 2024, of $19.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $975 million, $1.9 billion, and $3.9 billion.",

These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.'
