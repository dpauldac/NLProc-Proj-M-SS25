Project Progress Report - Alpha Phase Date: May 9, 2025

Project Name: Nexus Core System Development Phase: Alpha Testing Reporting Period: April 1, 2025 - April 30, 2025

1. Executive Summary: The Alpha phase of the Nexus Core System Development project concluded on schedule. Key functionalities for user authentication, data persistence, and basic API endpoints have been implemented and underwent initial internal testing. A total of 25 minor bugs and 3 critical issues were identified during the testing period. All critical issues have been resolved, and the minor bugs are slated for resolution in the upcoming Beta phase. Overall progress is positive, and the team remains confident in meeting the projected launch timeline.

2. Key Achievements:

Successful integration of OAuth2 for user authentication.
Database schema finalized and populated with initial test data.
API endpoints for user profile management and data retrieval are operational.
Test coverage increased to 70% for core modules.
Initial performance benchmarks show promising results within acceptable latency ranges.

3. Issues and Challenges:

Issue: Intermittent data synchronization errors between the primary and secondary database instances (Severity: Critical - Resolved). Root cause identified as a race condition during concurrent writes.
Issue: High CPU utilization observed during batch data processing tasks (Severity: Critical - Resolved). Optimized algorithm significantly reduced resource consumption.
Challenge: Integration with third-party payment gateway (pending vendor API updates). This will be a focus area for early Beta.

4. Next Steps (Beta Phase - May 2025):

Implement payment gateway integration.
Develop user interface for dashboard functionalities.
Expand test coverage to 90% across all modules.
Conduct external user acceptance testing (UAT) with selected pilot users.
Begin documentation for API and user guides.

5. Resource Allocation:

Development Team: 80% allocation to new features, 20% to bug fixing/refinement.
QA Team: 100% allocation to UAT and expanded test cases.
Operations Team: Preparing staging environment for Beta deployment.
